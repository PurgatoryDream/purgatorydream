I'm PurgatoryDream, a computer science student with a passion for gaming and software development. I'm mostly going to use this Github in order to upload some personal projects of mine, most likely related to games. For example, I might upload some tools I think could be useful for Yu-Gi-Oh!, or some other applications that I see people requesting in servers from communities I'm in. This is mostly for fun and to experiment, so feel free to suggest anything you might want to see!

Have fun, enjoy, and don't be afraid to reach out!
